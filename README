Hi!

This is my password generator. I really like green, if that's not obvious.

The purpose of this password generator is to provide an easy, yet safer means to protect your highly-sensitive data. HTML provides the blueprint, CSS makes it look pretty, and JavaScript handles the actual behavior of the generator.

Here is my Github link to said generator: https://github.com/BDGosen/barrets-cool-password-generator
